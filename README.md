# SVG LOGO Maker

![github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellowgreen.svg)

## Description
The creation of this application is for freelance web developers to quickly and easily generate a simple logo for projects that includes up to a three letter text inside a chosen shape. This application uses the creation of SVG files and is created with Object-oriented Programming. This project helped me learn how to create tests using Jest. Tests can be accessed under shapes.test.js inside the lib folder.

## Installation
Project Repository on GitHub: https://github.com/renrojas/svg-logo-maker

## Usage

Video Walkthrough - https://youtu.be/xsLxAObsxe0

To navigate this application, you will start by invoking the application by using the following Command: node index.js. You will then be guided through a set of questions which you will need to answer to create the SVG file for your logo. Once finished with the questions, you can access the file under the examples folder and right clicking 'Preview SVG' on the file logo.svg.
